      <p>There are many techniques to quilting and as many different patterns and styles. We choose to do a table runner because it's one of the simplest forms of quilting as it doesn't require any actual inner layer nor does it require that you take the piece to a person with a long arm showing machine to create the actual quilting pattern on the top and bottom of it.  This is a fun way to get started with quilting if you've always wanted to learn. 	  <br></br>
